# Introduction-to-Scala
A course I did that teaches the fundamentals of Scala programming.

## ex_1_1
Create Scala program (HelloScala.scala) that prints the text 'Hello World'

## ex_2_1
Create executable Scala object called Person.

Declare the following three variables:

| Variable name | Data type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| firstName | String | Lisa |
| lastName | String | Patterson |
| age | Integer | 32 |

Use string interpolation to print the following text.

```
First name: Lisa, Last name: Patterson, Age: 32 years
```

## ex_2_2
Create Scala executable object called Intials that asks firstname and lastname. The program will then print out the intials of a name.

## ex_3_1
Create Scala executable object called Initials. It contains method called printInitials that takes two string paramaters: firstName and lastName. The method prints the intials of the name parameters. Call the method using the following values: firstName = "John", lastName = "Smith".

## ex_3_3
Create executable Scala object called Square. Create a function called square inside the object. The square function takes one integer parameter and returns the square of given parameter.

The program asks an integer from a user and then prints the result.
